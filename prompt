I want you to build a comprehensive wedding planning platform for the Indian market. Unlike a standard e-commerce site, this is a "Managed Marketplace" where the platform acts as the intermediary layer between clients and vendors to ensure quality and trust.

## 1. Core Business Logic (The "Managed" Model)
- **No Direct Booking:** Users cannot "click and book" a vendor instantly. They "Request a Quote" or "Check Availability."
- **Anchor Service:** The platform is owned by a Decor/Tent company. The "Decor/Venue" package is the primary product; other services (Photography, Makeup) are add-ons.
- **Centralized Payments:** The user pays the Platform (Us), and the Platform pays the Vendors.

## 2. Key Features to Build

### A. Frontend (Client-Facing) - "The Package Builder"
Create a visual, drag-and-drop style "Wedding Builder" wizard with the following steps:
1.  **Step 1: Basic Info:** Date, City (Default: Ludhiana, Phagwara, jalandhar), Guest Count, Budget Range.
2.  **Step 2: Select Theme (The Anchor):** Show visual cards for Decor Themes (e.g., Royal Red, Floral Pastel, Minimalist). This is the base package.
3.  **Step 3: Add Services:** Users can toggle "Add-ons" like Photographer, Makeup Artist, Catering.
    - *Logic:* When they select "Photographer," show 3 tiers: Standard, Premium, Luxury (with dummy pricing). Don't show specific vendor names yet to prevent platform bypass.
4.  **Step 4: The Cart/Summary:** Show an estimated "Total Wedding Cost."
5.  **Step 5: Call to Action:** A button saying "Check Availability & Get Final Price" (Triggers lead capture form: Name, WhatsApp Number, Email).

### B. Vendor Logic (The "Invisible" Backend)
- **WhatsApp Integration Placeholder:** Design a system where vendor availability is checked via WhatsApp, not a login dashboard.
    - *Logic:* When a User requests a quote, the Admin receives the lead. The system should be ready to integrate with the WhatsApp Business API to send automated messages to vendors ("Are you free on Nov 24?").

### C. Admin Dashboard (For Me/Staff)
- **Lead Management:** A kanban board (New Lead -> Contacted -> Quote Sent -> Booked).
- **Vendor Database:** A simple CMS to add vendors with fields: Name, Category, Base Price, Phone Number, Portfolio Images.
- **Quotation Generator:** A tool to generate a PDF quote based on the user's selection in the "Package Builder."

## 3. Design Aesthetic & UX
- **Vibe:** Premium, trustworthy, celebratory but clean. Think "Pinterest meets Airbnb."
- **Color Palette:** Gold (#D4AF37) and Deep Royal Blue or Maroon for accents; plenty of whitespace.
- **Mobile-First:** 90% of users will visit via mobile. The "Package Builder" must work smoothly on touch screens.

## 4. Technical Stack Recommendations
- **Framework:** Next.js (for SEO and speed) or React.
- **Styling:** dont use Tailwind CSS (for rapid, modern UI).
- **Database:**  Firebase (for real-time vendor data and lead management).
- **CMS:** to easily manage the vendor portfolio and decor images.

## 5. Deliverables
Please generate the folder structure, the core code for the "Package Builder" component, the database schema for Users/Vendors/Leads, and the landing page layout. Start by explaining the architecture you plan to use.
